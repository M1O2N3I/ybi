Customer Segmentation with K-Means Clustering
Objective
Segment customers into distinct groups based on purchasing behavior to tailor marketing efforts.

Data Source
Customer purchase history dataset including features such as transaction amounts, frequency, and product categories.

Import Library
python
Copy code
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans
from sklearn.metrics import silhouette_score
Import Data
python
Copy code
data = pd.read_csv('customer_data.csv')
Describe Data
python
Copy code
data.info()
data.describe()
Data Visualization
python
Copy code
sns.pairplot(data[['transaction_amount', 'frequency']])
plt.show()
Data Preprocessing
python
Copy code
# Scale features
scaler = StandardScaler()
scaled_data = scaler.fit_transform(data[['transaction_amount', 'frequency']])
Define Target Variable (y) and Feature Variables (X)
For clustering, you donâ€™t have a target variable. Use feature variables for clustering.

python
Copy code
X = scaled_data
Train Test Split
Not applicable for clustering.

Modeling
python
Copy code
kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=5, random_state=42)
clusters = kmeans.fit_predict(X)
data['cluster'] = clusters
Model Evaluation
python
Copy code
print(silhouette_score(X, clusters))
Prediction
Not applicable for clustering.

Explanation
Analyze the characteristics of each cluster and how they can inform marketing strategies and customer outreach.
